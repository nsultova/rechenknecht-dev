Decided to learn some automation with ansible for my arch machine-learning setup, expecting to break things rather often. Crude, ongoing WIP :)

Current state 14-06-2024:
* Roles for setting up a vanilla arch system with addding various tools and custom configurations
* currently mamba is the environment manager of choice, simply because ML depencencies are cumbersome and I want my friends to be able to install things without sudo
* might add containers later but rn in no mood struggling with the docker vs wireguard vs kvm circus 
* Adding new users to the system with everything configured to allow them play around with ML
